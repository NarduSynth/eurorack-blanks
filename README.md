# Eurorack blank panels

Outline files for Eurorack panels of various sizes from 2HP (~10mm) all the way up to 20HP.

These are released into the public domain - you can do what you like with them; use them as blanking panels in your system or as a base for your own projects.

DXF files are in AutoCAD format (handy for use with laser cutters and the like) whereas FPD files are intended for Schaeffer's Front Panel Design software, which will export the files as DXF or SVG format.
